# What is this?
It's a collection of scripts that set up Linux Development Environments.

# But why?
I like using DistroBox Containers for Dev Environments and I wanted a script to quickly set things up.

# Syntax
```bash
./devenv-setup *--distro*
``` 

### Example
```bash
./devenv-setup --arch
```

### ATTENTION
Only Arch Linux is supported currently!

# Contributing
Bug reports, feature requests and PRs are welcome.

# To do
- [x] Arch Linux
- [ ] Debian
- [ ] Fedora

### Requests from friends :)
- [ ] CentOS

# How it looks
