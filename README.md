# What is this?
It's a script that sets up Linux Development Environments. This script is mainly meant for Arch Linux Environments but I plan on adding extra features for other Linux distros as well.

# But why?
I like using DistroBox Containers for Dev Environments and I wanted a script to quickly set things up.

# To do
- [x] Arch Linux
- [ ] Debian
- [ ] Fedora
- [ ] CentOS
